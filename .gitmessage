Why:

*

This change addresses the need by:

*

# Separate subject from body with a blank line
# Limit the subject line to 50 characters (69 is a hard limit)
# Capitalize the subject line
# Do not end the subject line with a period
# Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# Wrap the body at 72 characters
# Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
