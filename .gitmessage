FOOTER

# Please note that:
#  - The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that
#    contains a succinct description of the change. It contains a
#    type, an optional scope, and a subject
#       + <type> describes the kind of change that this commit is
#                providing. Allowed types are:
#             * feat (feature)
#             * fix (bug fix)
#             * docs (documentation)
#             * style (formatting, missing semicolons, â€¦)
#             * refactor
#             * test (when adding missing tests)
#             * chore (maintain)
#       + <scope> can be anything specifying the place of the commit
#                 change
#       + <subject> is a very short description of the change, in
#                   the following format:
#             * imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed"/"changes"
#             * no capitalised first letter
#             * no dot (.) at the end
#             * limit the subject line to 50 characters
#             * If applied, this commit will
#               ** refactor subsystem X for readability
#               ** update getting started documentation
#               ** remove deprecated methods
#               ** release version 1.0.0
#               ** merge pull request #123 from user/branch
#  - The BODY should include the motivation for the change and
#    contrast this with previous behavior and must be phrased in
#    imperative present tense
#  - The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking
#    Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that
#    this commit closes
